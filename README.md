# Antify Validate

Use one validation for client and server side.

## Rule to have the best ux and dx

- Do not use browser validation like `input[required=required]` or `input[type=email]` in your html form
- Reuse rules. You can find a predefined bullet proofed list of rules [here](./src/runtime/rules) 

## Development

- Run `npm run dev:prepare` to generate type stubs.
- Use `npm run dev` to start [playground](./playground) in development mode.
