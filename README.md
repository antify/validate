# Antify Validate

Use one validation for client and server side.

## Rule to have the best ux and dx

- Do not use browser validation like `input[required=required]` or `input[type=email]` in your html form
- Reuse rules. You can find a predefined bullet proofed list of rules [here](https://github.com/antify/validate/tree/main/src/rules) 

## Development

- Run `pnpm dev` to generate type stubs.
- Use `pnpm dev` to start tests in watch mode for development.
